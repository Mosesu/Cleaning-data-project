Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately label the data set with descriptive activity names.Converts the activity and subject columns into factors
Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.
The end result is shown in the file tidy.txt.
